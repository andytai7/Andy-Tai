As we delve into the complex interplay of genomics and environment in psychiatric disorders, the potential of machine learning (ML) and big data becomes increasingly apparent. My project, conducted at the University Health Network in Toronto, focuses on the transformative power of ML to redefine disease models and therapeutic discovery in psychiatry. By harnessing vast datasets, our research aims to refine psychiatric diagnosis and enhance therapeutic interventions. The complexity of mental disorders requires a multidimensional approach, and through our work, we're exploring innovative ways to personalize and revolutionize treatment in mental health. This journey not only challenges existing paradigms but also paves the way for significant advancements in the field.
