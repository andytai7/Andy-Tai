# Welcome to my website!

I am Andy Tai, a researcher and academic specializing in Healthcare and Data Science. At the University of British Columbia, I integrate advanced machine learning techniques to improve public health, particularly in predicting and mitigating risks related to mental health and substance use disorders.

My research portfolio includes a deep dive into the predictive analytics of fatal overdose risks within the realm of Addiction Psychiatry, using extensive datasets and innovative AI methodologies. I have contributed significantly to understanding how data-driven approaches can be employed to improve treatment outcomes and prevent fatalities in vulnerable populations.

Beyond my research, I am deeply committed to education and mentorship. I have had the privilege of shaping the minds of emerging scientists and data professionals, teaching over 30 courses as part of UBCâ€™s Masters of Data Science and Graduate Neuroscience programs. My teaching philosophy emphasizes practical experience, critical thinking, and ethical considerations in technology and healthcare.

Through my work with Generative AI, I have focused on developing applications that enhance diagnostic and therapeutic processes. A prime example is my involvement with the Blog Writer demo project at Aggregate Intellect. This initiative utilized LLMs to transform audio transcripts into engaging blog content automatically, showcasing the power of AI in streamlining content creation and enhancing information dissemination.

At Concussion RX, my role extends beyond traditional research; I leverage AI to revolutionize concussion management. By developing and implementing AI tools like ConcussionRX and Llama 3, we have significantly improved diagnosis accuracy and treatment efficacy. These tools analyze patient data in real-time, offering personalized treatment plans and predictive insights that are pivotal for recovery.

As a recently appointed as a Postdoctoral Teaching and Learning Fellow at the University of British Columbia's Master of Data Science Program. In this role, I am deeply involved in curriculum development and the delivery of cutting-edge courses in Statistics and Machine Learning. My responsibilities extend to training and supervising teaching assistants, as well as overseeing student Capstone projects, fostering a collaborative and innovative learning environment.

My teaching philosophy is rooted in a commitment to making complex concepts in data science accessible and engaging. I strive to integrate real-world applications into my lectures, emphasizing the ethical implications and societal impacts of data science and AI technologies. This approach not only enriches the learning experience but also prepares students to become thoughtful, responsible leaders in the field.

This website is a comprehensive showcase of my scholarly contributions, including peer-reviewed articles, conference presentations, and collaborative projects. You'll also find updates on my ongoing research endeavors and insights into future areas of study. I invite you to explore my work and connect with me for further discussions or collaborations.
